## What am I Interested in Learning?
##### I am interested in learning how to make apps more usable for others because if I want to create something, I want to be able to use it with ease and share with my friends if they ever need to use it too.

## What am I working on?
##### I am working to build up my speed within the T&F team. Ever since my injury near the end of the season, I have been held back up until now. Because all of my friends have been working to get stronger, that encourages me to catch up and push harder.

## What's your Favorite hobby?
##### I love to hang around with my friends can goof off on my free time. Having some time outside of school to enjoy life balances my life with school as I have both the time to lock in and enjoy childhood. Not only that, I like to participate in sports as it is pretty fun when playing with others. Sometimes I play games with my friends online and hop on vc, but I would rather just hang around with them afterschoool.
